          <h2>The technical reasons why the price of a rune like $MARSI could increase after every burn of the allocated supply</h2>
          <p>are rooted in basic economic principles of supply and demand. Here's a breakdown of the factors that contribute to a price increase following a rune burn:</p>
          <ul>
            <li className="level1">1. Decreased Supply (Scarcity)</li>
            <ul>
              <li className="level2">- Burning Mechanism: When a portion of the total supply of $MARSI is burned, it is permanently removed from circulation. For example, if 9.99% of the total supply is burned every month, this directly reduces the total circulating supply of $MARSI in the market.</li>
              <li className="level2">- Scarcity and Value: According to basic economics, when the supply of something decreases while demand remains the same (or increases), its perceived value generally increases. As fewer runes are available in the market, the scarcity effect drives up demand, which in turn pushes up the price. This principle is similar to how rare items or limited-edition assets often become more valuable over time.</li>
              <li className="level2">- Deflationary Nature: By reducing the supply consistently through burns, $MARSI becomes a deflationary rune. This means that over time, the total available supply will keep shrinking, making the remaining supply potentially more valuable if demand continues or increases.</li>
            </ul>
            <li className="level1">2. Increased Perceived Value (Demand-Supply Imbalance)</li>
            <ul>
              <li className="level2">- Increased Demand: When holders see that runes are being burned regularly, they often perceive that the asset is becoming scarcer, which can create a sense of urgency or excitement in the community. This is FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), which often leads to more people wanting to buy the rune before they become even scarcer.</li>
              <li className="level2">- Holders Anticipate Higher Value: Over time, as the burn process reduces the supply, holders may expect the price to rise because they anticipate that with fewer runes in circulation, those that remain will be worth more.</li>
              <li className="level2">- Psychological Impact: As the total supply gets reduced, the rune might be viewed as a "rare commodity" or something that could become a collector’s item.</li>
            </ul>
            <li className="level1">3. Market Liquidity & Token Velocity</li>
            <ul>
              <li className="level2">- Liquidity Impact: When a rune’s circulating supply decreases, there is less available for trading, which means each transaction could have a larger price impact.</li>
              <li className="level2">- Velocity of the Token: The velocity of the token (how often it changes hands) can be affected by supply reductions.</li>
            </ul>
            <li className="level1">4. Burn Events Create Marketing Hype & FOMO</li>
            <ul>
              <li className="level2">- Community & Marketing Impact: The burn process itself becomes a marketing event.</li>
              <li className="level2">- Community Engagement: As people become aware of the deflationary nature of $MARSI, it creates a sense of exclusivity and excitement.</li>
            </ul>
            <li className="level1">5. Reduced Selling Pressure</li>
            <ul>
              <li className="level2">- Holding Incentives: When a burn event occurs, holders may become more incentivized to hold their $MARSI.</li>
              <li className="level2">- FOMO & Fear of Missing Out: If people believe that burning is happening, they may hold off on selling.</li>
            </ul>
            <li className="level1">6. Economic Models of Burn and Buybacks</li>
            <ul>
              <li className="level2">- Rune Burn as a Deflationary Mechanism: Token burns are often seen as a deflationary mechanism in cryptocurrency.</li>
              <li className="level2">- Burns & Scarcity: As the total supply decreases, holders and potential buyers will realize that fewer runes are available.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

          <h2>Conclusion: How Burns Lead to Price Increase</h2>
          <p>To summarize, the key technical reasons why the price of $MARSI will likely increase after each burn event are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li className="level1">1. Decreased circulating supply (scarcity increases value).</li>
            <li className="level1">2. Increased perceived value due to the scarcity effect.</li>
            <li className="level1">3. Psychological factors like FOMO, where the community anticipates higher prices.</li>
            <li className="level1">4. Reduced liquidity, making each $MARSI more impactful when traded.</li>
            <li className="level1">5. Incentives to hold runes (reduced selling pressure).</li>
            <li className="level1">6. Increased buying pressure, as more people realize the deflationary nature of the rune.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Thus, the regular burning of runes creates a deflationary environment that could result in higher demand, scarcity, and ultimately, higher prices for the remaining circulating $MARSI over time. More coming soon...</p>
